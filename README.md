# Indonesia Family Life Survey: Data Wrangling and Variable Generation
Playing around with IFLS (Indonesia Family Life Survey) data to generate total household expenditures, total per capita expenditure, total household asset, total past loan, and total current loan variables.

The complete IFLS dataset are publicly available for download on https://www.rand.org/well-being/social-and-behavioral-policy/data/FLS/IFLS/access.html.
Specific for this repository, I utilize the following IFLS Wave 5 Survey Data: b1_ks0, b1_ks1, b1_ks2, b1_ks3, b2_bh, b2_hr1, b2_kr, and bk_ar1.
